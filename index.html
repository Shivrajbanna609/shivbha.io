            <h1>Sankhat Shivbhadrasinh</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Sankhat Shivbhadrasinh, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Technology
                (B.Tech) at
                Parul University. I have a strong passion for technology and a keen interest in the field of web
                development.
                I am a highly motivated web developer with two years of professional experience specializing in HTML,
                CSS,
                and JavaScript. I have worked on two notable projects, namely "Gujarat Paribharaman" and "Chanakya
                Neeti,"
                where I contributed to the development and maintenance of web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my web development expertise, I also possess one year of experience in graphic design. I
                have
                worked extensively with Adobe Photoshop, creating visually appealing designs and collaborating with
                clients
                to fulfill their design requirements.

                Driven by my passion for user-centric design, I am currently expanding my skillset in UI/UX design. I am
                actively learning and exploring the intricacies of creating intuitive and engaging user interfaces using
                tools such as Figma.
